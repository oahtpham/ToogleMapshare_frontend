# README


[ToogleMapshare](https://tooglemapshare.herokuapp.com/) is a single page web application clone of Google Maps with an added social functionality. It is an interactive mapping tool allowing the user to create lists with pins of their favorite places. Users can also see pins and reviews from their friends.

### Technologies
ToogleMapshare was created with a Ruby on Rails backend with a PostgresSQL database and a React/Redux frontend. Additional frameworks and libraries used include:

* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - for mobile-friendly, interactive maps
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - for the design pattern of the application

### Key Features

#### Interactive Map

Users can search specific locations on a map to see the pins in the area. Based on the area searched, the map will zoom in accordingly and display pins at that location. Users can then hover over each pin to view location or click on the pin for further details of each place including who has pinned it and any reviews by friends.

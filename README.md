This application is an interactive mapping tool allowing users to create lists with pins of their favorite places. It was created as my capstone project at Flatiron's School for Software Engineering.

The tools, frameworks, and libraries used to create this include:

- Javascript
- React/Redux (front-end)
- Ruby on Rails API (back-end)
- Leaflet Library (front-end map display)
- Yelp Fusion API (access to search thousands of points of interests)
- Material UI Design
